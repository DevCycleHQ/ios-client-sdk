# Install using Swift Package Manager

This example app is setup to use the local DevCycle iOS SDK from this git repo,
but you can install the remote version of the SDK using SPM:

1. Open the project in Xcode.
2. Go to **File > Add Packages...**
3. Enter the DevCycle SDK repository URL:

   ```
   https://github.com/DevCycleHQ/ios-client-sdk.git
   ```
4. Choose the version you want to use and add the package to your app target.
